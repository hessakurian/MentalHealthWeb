    <h2> Around the world, people have different outlooks on mental health. It is common for mental health to not be taken as a serious matter. This creates a stigma around mental health, which makes it difficult for individuals to seek professional help. The purpose of this website is to raise awareness about the importance of easy access to mental health care and the dangers of stigma.</h2>

      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health systems, around the world, are significantly under-resourced and the treatments are often “poor in quality.” Moreover, in 2019, 970 million people were dealing with anxiety and depression globally. Not receiving proper mental health care can worsen an individual's well-being and create problems in their relationships, schools, and workplaces. </h5>
